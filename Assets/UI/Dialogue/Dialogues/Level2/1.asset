  dialogue:
  - '*The crab sits on a rock, inspecting a rusty sword with its claw as the pirate
    stumbles toward it, soaked and exhausted.*'
  - 'Crab:

    Oh, look who decided to wash up on my shore! And here I thought I''d
    keep this little beauty for myself.'
  - '*The pirate stares at the sword, his eyes lighting up.*'
  - "Yes, yes, I know. \"It's my sword!\" you were probably about to say. Found it
    washed up on the shore. Thought I\u2019d give it a spin myself!"
  - '*The pirate nods, gripping the sword, ready to swing.*'
  - "Crab:\nHold on, sailor! This thing\u2019s got a few tricks you\u2019ll need
    to learn. Give it a quick swipe with your left mouse click, for starters."
  - '*The pirate grins, carefully holding the sword testing its weight.*'
  - "Crab:\nAnd if you\u2019re feeling fancy, hold down that left mouse click to
    really wind up a throw. Just... try not to lose it, alright?"
  - "Crab:\nThere you go! Now, go on\u2014give it a whirl. And remember, if you lose
    it again, don\u2019t expect me to fish it out of the waves for you!"
