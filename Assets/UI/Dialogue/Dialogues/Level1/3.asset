  - 'Crab:

    Ah, look at that! Totems with a trigger-happy streak.

'
  - "Crab:\nThey\u2019ll shoot at anything that moves\u2026 which includes you, genius."
  - "Crab:\nThey\u2019ll shoot at anything that moves\u2026 which includes you, genius."
  - "Crab:\nHere\u2019s the deal: you\u2019re going to run past them without getting
    hit, and while you\u2019re at it, avoid those spikes. They\u2019re not just for
    decoration."
  - '*The pirate stares at the maze of obstacles, looking unsure.*'
  - "Crab: \nOh, and one more thing\u2014see those coins scattered around? You\u2019re
    going to need to grab at least 80% of them. No shortcuts here."
  - "Crab: \nYou want me to let you through to the next area? Then prove you\u2019re
    not completely useless and collect those coins."
  - "Crab: \nOr do you think you can bribe me with your looks alone?"
  - '*The crab pauses, giving him a once-over*'
  - "Crab:\nEww didn\u2019t think so. Now, get moving! Dodge, jump, grab, repeat.
    Or do I have to spell it out slower for you?"
