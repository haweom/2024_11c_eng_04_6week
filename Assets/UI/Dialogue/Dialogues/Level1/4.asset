  - "Crab:\nListen up, Captain Dense, we\u2019re stepping things up a notch. See
    that cracked wall over there?"
  - '*The captain nods with approval*'
  - "Crab:\nThat\u2019s not just for show. Use a bomb to blow it open.\n"
  - '*The pirate fumbles with a bomb, looking a bit unsure.*'
  - "Crab:\nGood grief. It\u2019s not rocket science. Place it, step back, and boom.
    Think you can manage that without taking your own head off?"
  - '*The pirate nods once again, now determined.*'
  - "Crab:\nGreat. Now, about those platforms ahead. They\u2019re rigged to fall
    as soon as you step on them."
  - "Crab:\nAnd guess what\u2019s below? A lovely bed of spikes, just waiting for
    a careless pirate like you."
  - "Crab:\nSo unless you fancy getting skewered, move fast and don\u2019t linger."
  - '*The crab chuckles, clearly amused.*'
  - 'Crab:

    Just try not to be the first pirate in history to be outsmarted by
    a platform.'
  - '*The crab burst into laughter, clearly impressed with his own sense of humor*'
