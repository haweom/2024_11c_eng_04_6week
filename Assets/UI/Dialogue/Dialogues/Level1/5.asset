  - "Crab: \nWell, color me surprised\u2014you\u2019ve actually made it this far.
    Didn\u2019t think you had it in you, Captain Determined."
  - "Crab: \nBut don\u2019t start celebrating just yet. Things are about to get\u2026
    interesting."
  - '*The pirate raises an eyebrow, unsure if he should feel proud or worried.*'
  - "Crab:\nMeet the locals. Some call them \u2018Patricks.\u2019 Big, overgrown
    sea stars with a nasty habit.\n"
  - "Crab:\nThey don\u2019t just sit around looking pretty\u2014they\u2019ve got
    one thing on their minds"
  - 'Crab:

    To kill and devour.'
  - 'Crab:

    And you, my friend, are right on the menu.'
  - '*The crab leans in, almost whispering.*'
  - "Crab:\nWord of advice? Don\u2019t let them get close. They\u2019re faster than
    they look and twice as hungry.\n"
  - '*The pirate looks around, tense but determined.*'
  - "Crab:\nNow, go on, show me some of that \u2018legendary pirate courage.\u2019
    Who knows? I might actually start thinking you\u2019re worth finding the bottle."
