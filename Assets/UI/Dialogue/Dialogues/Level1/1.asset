  - '*The crab watches the pirate with an unamused expression as he stumbles onto
    the shore, dripping wet and bewildered*'
  - 'Crab:

    Oh, brilliant. Just what this island needed... A waterlogged pirate
    with more ambition than brains.'
  - '*The pirate scowls, wringing out his shirt.*'
  - 'Crab:

    What, hoping for a grand welcome? Sorry, but the only treasure around
    here is disappointment.

'
  - '*The pirate straightens, puffing up his chest.*'
  - 'Crab:

    Ohh... you must be here for the bottle. The one everyone thinks they
    are destined to find, just before being eaten alive, or driven mad by the jungle.'
  - 'Crab:

    It''s your lucky day as i know where it is. Only thing i require
    are coins that you will find on the way to it.'
  - 'Crab:

    But judging by the look of you I doubt you''ll make it past the beach...'
  - '*The pirate glares, undeterred.*'
  - 'Crab:

    You are adorable... All right follow me Mr.Captain delusional. But
    dont expect me to hold your hand. I would rather watch you die.'
  - '*The pirate angrily tries to pull out his sword. Only to find that it''s been
    lost to the sea when his ship has crashed.*

'
  - 'Crab:

    Ohh lost your sword didn''t you? Don''t worry Captain Helpless. It
    wouldn''t save you from my wrath anyway.

'
  - "Crab:\nAll right, Captain Pathetic, first lesson\u2014try getting yourself on
    top of that rock over there."
  - '*The pirate suddenly remembers that he can use SPACE to jump*'
  - '*He can also hold it down to get more power from the jump*'
  - "Crab:\nWhat\u2019s the holdup? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re stumped by a little
    jump! Go on."
